The base files are much to large to store in the repo in bulk, and for development purposes, can make building the images very slow as well.
There should be a better solution to this for a scaled application, but for the time being, including this folder as the base dir.
Just transfer any sportvu data over as an example, below is an example of the expected folder/file format:

    > 01.22.2016.LAC.at.NYK
        - 0021500648.json
